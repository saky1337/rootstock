Liquid crystalline materials with novel optical properties are crucial for advancing optoelectronic applications.
However, the development of new liquid crystalline compounds that exhibit both unique mesophase behaviors and distinct fluorescence characteristics remains underexplored.
This study addresses this gap by focusing on Y-shaped liquid crystalline compounds incorporating oxadiazole moieties.
We present a streamlined and cost-effective synthesis of highly fluorescent Y-shaped mesogens, offering a practical approach with high purity and industrial feasibility.
Thermal characterization using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) reveals novel mesophase behaviors: linear alkyl-substituted tris(oxadiazolyl)benzenes (TOBs) exhibit a pseudo-monotropic mesophase, while branched alkyl chain derivatives display unusually broad mesophase ranges.
Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) analysis further reveals a hexagonal columnar arrangement with an aromatic Ï€-stacking distance of 0.44 nm.
Optical studies show bright turquoise fluorescence with significant hypsochromic shifts in non-polar solvents, such as cyclohexane.
This research successfully demonstrates how Y-shaped mesogens can exhibit novel mesophase behaviors and fluorescence properties, challenging existing assumptions about the mesophase stability and optical behavior of liquid crystals.
Our findings offer a new perspective on the design and application of liquid crystalline materials, potentially leading to more efficient and versatile optoelectronic devices.
